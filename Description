These are the projects I have worked on in Python and R. They involved data cleaning, data exploration, data visualization, model building and model evaluation. 
The core principle was to apply all the skills I had learnt in an academic setting on actual data that had huge significance on different industries. 
The projects utilized most of the Python and R packages used daily to active a data science task.
